fetch valid: (arg1_valid == 1) || (arg0_ready == 1)

write instruction: 
    store the 1x1 byte into 2-D line buffer
    export 1x9 slice into 1-D line buffer (abstract slice stream)
    export 9x9 stencil to stencil buffer (abstract stencil stream)

    assumption: (arg1_ready == 1)
    (arg1_valid == 1) 
    (*) buffer index should help partition the instruction space, but different 
        implementations have different buffer index.

read instruction:
    apply gaussain operation on the stencil and output to the port

    (arg_0_ready == 1)

inputs:
    arg0_ready
    arg1_data
    arg1_valid

arch states:
    arg0_data
    arg0_valid
    arg1_ready

    eight 488x1 bytes buffer in 2-D line buffer: 
        modeled by memory
    x counter in 2-D line buffer
    y counter in 2-D line buffer
    one 1x9 bytes slice in slice streamer
    eight 1x9 bytes slice in 1-D line buffer
    one 9x9 bytes stencil in stencil streamer 
    (*) buffer index in 2-D line buffer
    (*) stream buffer status

possible child states:
    SW: internal states in line buffer, buffer index
    HW: internal states in line buffer, fsm state
